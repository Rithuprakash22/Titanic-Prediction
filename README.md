🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction App
A Machine Learning web application built using **Streamlit** and **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on personal and travel details.

📌 Project Overview

This project uses the Titanic dataset to train a classification model that predicts passenger survival using the following features:
- Passenger Class  
- Gender  
- Age  
- Number of Family Members  
- Port of Embarkation  

The trained model is deployed using Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface.

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Streamlit
